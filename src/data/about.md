# Maluhia from O’ahu 

I spent my adolescence on O’ahu, an island in Hawaii. The culture and nature of Hawaii has nurtured my personality and world views. The star-dangling night skies cultivated my curiosity beyond what’s in front of me. Maluhia means “serenity” in Hawaiian, a summarization of my belief to take things with confidence but also calmness.

# The dancer 

Music has always been a fundamental part of my life. And I love moving to it. Being a dancer for more than a decade has allowed me to understand how artistic expressions resonate with the eyes and ears. 

# Love for people and things 

I am a student dual-enrolled at Babson College and Olin College of Engineering. I am captivated by machines and how they work. It is fascinating to discover and push the limits of their capabilities. I also love people. I enjoy connecting and working with different people. If there’s enough time, I would get to know every person on this planet. As a result of my passions, I became the president of CODE on campus.
