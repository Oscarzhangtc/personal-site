The culture and nature of Hawaii has nurtured my personality and world views. The star-dangling night skies cultivated my curiosity beyond what\u2019s in front of me. Maluhia means \u201cserenity\u201d in Hawaiian, a summarization of my belief to take things with confidence but also calmness.\n\n# The dancer \n\nMusic has always been a fundamental part of my life.
